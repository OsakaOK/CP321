    "The goal of this project is to collect data on a variety of important aspects of Ontario, such as the number of tourists, COVID-19 cases, unemployment rates, and greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, I want to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism industry in Ontario by looking at the number of tourists who visited prior to the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I'm interested in following the progression of COVID-19 cases in Ontario to learn more about the pandemic's impact on public health in the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research then moves on to the number of unemployed people in Ontario, as many people are struggling to find work during the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I chose greenhouse gas emission data to provide a visualization of the country's usage, to see the state of the environment throughout the year, to understand the impact of human activities on the environment, and to develop strategies for reducing emissions."
