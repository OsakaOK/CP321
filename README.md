# *CP321*
Assignment1, Assignment 2 and Final Project 

## *Assignment 1*
Really simple and straight forward instruction provide inside the folder.

There is 3 questions, all use the same datasets, provide inside the folder name "Assignment1".

## *Assignment 2*
A bit challenging in last questions, suggest to look at class examples (if provided by prof.)

There is 2 questions, use different datasets, Q1 is easy, Q2 took some time to play around with it a bit frustrated but feel good when figured it out, everything is provide inside the folder name "Assignment2"


## *Final Project*
The requirement is little provide, but overall it is easy to do. We have all freedom to explore datasets and use as many as we want, do not need to worry about the documentation part as long as it can explain the purpose of visualization.

In my case I decided to use 4 datasets, all related to Ontario, and all included in the folder.

Everything project related is include in the folder, Feel free to explore the "Final_Project" and use it as an example to get an ideas.
